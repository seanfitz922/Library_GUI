Date: 7/23/2023
Version: 1.0.0
Description: A library database manager with a graphical user interface.
Requirements: Python 3.9

How to run:

1.1 Double click on the Python executable called LibraryGUI.

1.2 Select 'Open File' to open a preexisting CSV file or 'New File' to name and create a new one. 
      I recommend to open the CSV file titled "Example" to get a gist of how books will be displayed.

1.3  Utilize the menu bar on the top to add, remove, edit, or sort the books displayed.
